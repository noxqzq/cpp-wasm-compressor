# WASM File Compressor

WASM File Compressor is a fully local, browser-based file compression tool built using C++ and WebAssembly.
All compression and decompression is performed entirely on the client side, with **no server, no backend, and no file uploads**.

This project demonstrates high-performance native code running in the browser, manual memory management in WebAssembly, and efficient JavaScript–WASM interoperability.
